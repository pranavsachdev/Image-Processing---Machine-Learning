# Image-processing / machine learning - Removed coffee stains (noise) from dirty documents
 
Developed multiple image processing and machine learning approaches in R to remove noise in the scanned documents and ensemble using Xgboost to improve the output quality of the OCR process of digitizing documents.

Tools - R
Techniques - 
  1. Edge detection and morphology (BiOps package)
  2. Median filtering
  3. Adaptive thresholding
  4. Feature engineering - Identifying gaps between sentences
  5. XgBoost ensemble
